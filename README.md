# zokrates-preprocessor
Code to allow more compact formatting of the [Zokrates](https://github.com/Zokrates/ZoKrates) dsl.

If you are working with Zero Knowledge Proofs, you often want to implement a circuit for a function that operates on individual bits - such as a sha hash or cipher.  If you are using the Zokrates domain specific language (dsl) to develop your proof then that can lead to function calls with very long lists of variables.  Additionally, there are probably many lines of bitwise comparisons.  It's easy to end up in cut and paste hell, with a hard to find bug in what is quite a big file.

This zokrates preprocessor will let you write your code in a compact format that we call pcode.  The preprocessor will read the pcode file and turn it into a common-or-garden Zokrates dsl (.code) file.  You can happily mix standard Zokrates dsl and pcode in a .pcode file.  The preprocessor will simply ignore anything that is already in Zokrates dsl format.

The preprocessor depends on `yargs` so install that first from the root of the repository:

`npm install yargs`

to run the preprocessor from the root of the repository, do:

`node src/tools-code-preprop.js -i <myPcodeFilePath>`

The Zokrates dsl will be output to the terminal.  You can capture it into a file with: 

`node src/tools-code-preprop.js -i <myPcodeFilePath> > <myCodeFilePath>`

The following is a detailed description of the pcode syntax:

## Syntax discussed here:
### `....` (4 dots)

`500....123` - copy number 500 times

`500....abc123` - copy string 500 times

### `...` (3 dots)  

`a63...0` - decreasing repetition of variable

`b63...32` - decreasing repetition of variable

`'field' £a63...0` - decreasing repetition of parameter declarations

`[*]63...0` - decreasing repetition of a phrase, in a comma-separated in-line format

`[ * [ *# ]127...0 ]63...0` - nesting of the above

`{*}63...0` - decreasing repetition of a phrase, in a new-line-separated format

`{ * { *# }127...0 }63...0` - nesting of the above

`z==63...0==Z` - decreasing repetition of equality checks

### Field

`)->(field64):` - declare number and type of function outputs

## Repeat string/value

`....` (4 dots)

Results in constant repetition of a string.
This was inspired by the need to add padding with hundreds of 0's.

E.g. `128....0`

will produce a string `0, 0, 0,`...`, 0, 0` (128 0's separated by commas), or

`4....word01`

 will produce a string of `word01, word01, word01, word01` (4 words separated by commas)

## Ellipsis

Ellipsis `...` (3 dots) are syntax for 'decreasing repetition'.
There are a few different ways to use ellipsis:

### Declaring Variables - Decreasing Variable Repetition Syntax

#### `a63...0`

_WARNING: see the next section for declaring parameters to functions_

Type declarations aren't needed in the _body_ of a .code file.

E.g.`a63...0` expands out to:

`b63, b62,........., b1, b0` (i.e. every 'b' value from b63 to b0)

E.g. `a63...32` expands out to:

`b63, b62,........., b33, b32` (i.e. 'a' values from a63 to a32)



### Declaring Parameters (within functions) - Decreasing Parameter Repetition Syntax

#### `'field' £a63...0`

The 'new' zokrates (as at November 2018) requires 'type' declaration of function parameters.
ZoKrates types are:

`field`, `field[n]`, `bool` (bool has limited functionality). We currently use `field` all of the time.

**_Without_** .pcode syntax (i.e. using regular .code syntax) a function declaration would be as follows:

E.g. `def main(field a, private field b2, private field b1, private field b0)->(field, field, field, field, field, field, field, field):`

where `a` is a public input of type `field`, and `b2, b1, b0` are private inputs of type `field`.

You **must** now always specify the number and type of all output values. The section `->(field, field, field, field, field, field, field, field):` specifies that the function returns 8 values of type `field`.

**_With_** .pcode syntax, the above can be abbreviated to:

`def main(field a, 'field' £b2...0)->(field8):`  

where:

`b2...0` denotes decreasing repetition to `b2, b1, b0`

`£` denotes `private` parameters

`field` is standard .code syntax

`'field'` (_with_ inverted commas `''`) denotes the type to repeatedly apply to a Decreasing Repetition Syntax `£b2...0`

`)->(field8):` _NOTE NO SPACES from the closing bracket through to `:`_. This is syntax which expands to `->(field, field, field, field, field, field, field, field):`

### Lazy expansion of phrases - Decreasing Phrase Repetition Syntax

#### Comma-separated repetition of phrases `[*]63...0`:

E.g. `return [XOR(a*, b*, c0)]3...0`  

is .pcode syntax which expands to .code syntax:

`return XOR(a3, b3, c0), XOR(a2, b2, c0), XOR(a1, b1, c0), XOR(a0, b0, c0)`

E.g.  `return [a*, b2...0]3...0`

will first expand the outside brackets to:

`a3, b2...0, a2, b2...0, a1, b2...0, a0, b2...0`

And secondly then to:

`a3, b2, b1, b0, a2, b2, b1, b0, a1, b2, b1, b0, a0, b2, b1, b0`

Note that the brackets to return a comma-separated phrase expansion are SQUARE

#### `[ * [ *# ]127...0 ]63...0` - nesting of the above (comma separation)

This enables nesting of `[ * [ *# ]]` (only one level of nesting):
First the standalone `*` is replaced with a number. Then the `*#` is replaced with `*`. Then on the next pass, the newly created `*` is replaced with a number.

See the similar section on squiggly brackets for a set of similar examples.

#### New-Line repetition of phrases `{*}63...0`:
Similar to the above comma-separation syntax, except instead of outputting a comma-separated list, it outputs the data separated by new lines.

E.g. complicated variable expansion:

`{a*b63...0}7...0`

will first expand the outside ellipsis to give:

```
a7b63...0
a6b63...0
  
..........  

a0b63...0
```

And secondly then to:

```
a7b63, a7b62, a7b61,..., a7b0
a6b63, a6b62, a6b61,..., a6b0

...........  

a0b63, a0b62, a0b61,..., a0b0
```

E.g. complicated expression expansion:

`{c*b127...0 = unpack128(c*b)}7...0`

will first expand the outside ellipsis to give:

```
c7b127...0 = unpack128(c7b)
c6b127...0 = unpack128(c6b)

.............

c1b127...0 = unpack128(c1b) 
c0b127...0 = unpack128(c0b)
```

And secondly then to:

```
c7b127, c7b126, c7b125,`...`, c7b2, c7b1, c7b0 = unpack128(c7b)
c6b127, c6b126, c6b125,`...`, c6b2, c6b1, c6b0 = unpack128(c6b)

.............

c1b127, c1b126, c1b125,`...`, c1b2, c1b1, c1b0 = unpack128(c0b)
c0b127, c0b126, c0b125,`...`, c0b2, c0b1, c0b0 = unpack128(c0b)
```

Powerful!

E.g. multi-line complicated expression expansion:

```
{t63...0 = XOR2x64(c63...0, c*b63...0)
t511...0 = PAD64to512(t63...0)
c255...0 = sha256compression(t511...0)}6...1
```

will first expand the outside ellipsis to give:  

```
t63...0 = XOR2x64(c63...0, c6b63...0)
t511...0 = PAD64to512(t63...0)
c255...0 = sha256compression(t511...0)

t63...0 = XOR2x64(c63...0, c5b63...0)
t511...0 = PAD64to512(t63...0)
c255...0 = sha256compression(t511...0)

...........

t63...0 = XOR2x64(c63...0, c2b63...0)
t511...0 = PAD64to512(t63...0)
c255...0 = sha256compression(t511...0)

t63...0 = XOR2x64(c63...0, c1b63...0)
t511...0 = PAD64to512(t63...0)
c255...0 = sha256compression(t511...0)
```

And secondly then to:

```
t63, t62, ..... t2, t1, t0 = XOR2x64(c63, c62,..... c2, c1, c0, c6b63, c6b63, ..... c6b1, c6b0)
t511, t510, ..... t2, t1, t0 = PAD64to512(t63, t62,  ..... t1, t0)
c255, c254, ..... c2, c1, c0 = sha256compression(t511, t510, ..... t1, t0)

t63, t62, ..... t2, t1, t0 = XOR2x64(c63, c62, ..... c2, c1, c0, c5b63, c5b63, ..... c5b1, c5b0)
t511, t510, ..... t2, t1, t0 = PAD64to512(t63, t62, ..... t1, t0)
c255, c254, ..... c2, c1, c0 = sha256compression(t511, t510, ..... t1, t0)

...........

t63, t62, ..... t2, t1, t0 = XOR2x64(c63, c62, ..... c2, c1, c0, c2b63, c2b63, ..... c2b1, c2b0)
t511, t510, ..... t2, t1, t0 = PAD64to512(t63, t62, ..... t1, t0)
c255, c254, ..... c2, c1, c0 = sha256compression(t511, t510, ..... t1, t0)

t63, t62, ..... t2, t1, t0 = XOR2x64(c63, c62,..... c2, c1, c0, c1b63, c1b63, ..... c1b1, c1b0)
t511, t510, ..... t2, t1, t0 = PAD64to512(t63, t62, ..... t1, t0)
c255, c254, ..... c2, c1, c0 = sha256compression(t511, t510, ..... t1, t0)
```

Note that the brackets to return a new-line-separated phrase expansion are SQUIGGLY

#### `{ * { *# }127...0 }63...0` - nesting of the above (new line separation)

This enables nesting of `{ * { *# }}` (only one level of nesting):
First the standalone `*` is replaced with a number. Then the `*#` is replaced with `*`. Then on the next pass, the newly created `*` is replaced with a number.

E.g. (simple example)
```
{ X* = A* + B*
{ Y*# = C*# + D* }127...0 }63...0
```
will first expand the standalone `*`, and replace `*#` with `*` to become:
```
X63 = A63 + B63
{ Y* = C* + D63 }127...0

X62 = A62 + B62
{ Y* = C* + D62 }127...0

//etc.

X0 = A0 + B0
{ Y* = C* + D0 }127...0
```
and will then expand the newly created standalone `*`:
```
X63 = A63 + B63
Y127 = C127 + D63
Y126 = C126 + D63
//etc.
Y0 = C0 + D63

X62 = A62 + B62
Y127 = C127 + D63
Y126 = C126 + D63
//etc.
Y0 = C0 + D63

//etc.

X0 = A0 + B0
Y127 = C127 + D63
Y126 = C126 + D63
//etc.
Y0 = C0 + D63
```


E.g. (real world example)

```
{ isZero = ISZERO64x64(t63...0, d*b63...0)
t63...0 = XOR2x64(t63...0, d*b63...0)
t511...0 = shaPad64To512(t63...0)
t255...0 = sha256compression(t511...0)
{t*# = if isZero==1 then 0 else t*# fi }255...0 }31...1
```
will first expand the standalone `*`, and replace `*#` with `*` to become:
```
isZero = ISZERO64x64(t63...0, d31b63...0)
t63...0 = XOR2x64(t63...0, d31b63...0)
t511...0 = shaPad64To512(t63...0)
t255...0 = sha256compression(t511...0)
{t* = if isZero==1 then 0 else t* fi }255...0

isZero = ISZERO64x64(t63...0, d30b63...0)
t63...0 = XOR2x64(t63...0, d30b63...0)
t511...0 = shaPad64To512(t63...0)
t255...0 = sha256compression(t511...0)
{t* = if isZero==1 then 0 else t* fi }255...0

//etc.

isZero = ISZERO64x64(t63...0, d0b63...0)
t63...0 = XOR2x64(t63...0, d0b63...0)
t511...0 = shaPad64To512(t63...0)
t255...0 = sha256compression(t511...0)
{t* = if isZero==1 then 0 else t* fi }255...0
```
will secondly expand the newly created `*` to become:
```
isZero = ISZERO64x64(t63...0, d31b63...0)
t63...0 = XOR2x64(t63...0, d31b63...0)
t511...0 = shaPad64To512(t63...0)
t255...0 = sha256compression(t511...0)
t255 = if isZero==1 then 0 else t255 fi
t254 = if isZero==1 then 0 else t254 fi
//etc...
t0 = if isZero==1 then 0 else t0 fi

isZero = ISZERO64x64(t63...0, d30b63...0)
t63...0 = XOR2x64(t63...0, d30b63...0)
t511...0 = shaPad64To512(t63...0)
t255...0 = sha256compression(t511...0)
t255 = if isZero==1 then 0 else t255 fi
t254 = if isZero==1 then 0 else t254 fi
//etc...
t0 = if isZero==1 then 0 else t0 fi

//etc.

isZero = ISZERO64x64(t63...0, d0b63...0)
t63...0 = XOR2x64(t63...0, d0b63...0)
t511...0 = shaPad64To512(t63...0)
t255...0 = sha256compression(t511...0)
t255 = if isZero==1 then 0 else t255 fi
t254 = if isZero==1 then 0 else t254 fi
//etc.
t0 = if isZero==1 then 0 else t0 fi
```
And then finally the standard ellipsis notation `...` will be expanded.

#### Repetition of equality checks `z==63...0==Z`:

E.g. `z==63...0==Z`

will expand to:

`z0==Z0`
`z1==Z1`

........

`z62==Z62`
`z63==Z63`

Note: this could also be achieved with star and squiggly bracket notation:

E.g. `{z*==Z*}63...0`

will expand to:

```
z63==Z63
z62==Z62

.......

z1==Z1
z0==Z0
```
